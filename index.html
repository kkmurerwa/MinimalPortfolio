            By now, you probably know my name already. I am Kenneth Murerwa, a software developer with a particular leaning towards mobile applications and especially Android development. You're also probably wondering why this website looks as bare as it does. I am a stern believer of doing more with less. This portfolio is a protestation against modern design strategies that prioritize aesthetics over accessibilty and not a testament to my design limitations (which are non-existent). I made this portfolio with the slowest devices in mind. It should be able to load on a device with 45KB of RAM and a flimsy GPRS internet connection with no hassle.

            That aside, I love writing code, learning, and most importantly challenges. I am proficient in Java, Kotlin, Javascript and Flutter and familiar with Python, tools that I use for my trade. I also like trying out new challenges on sites like <a href="https://www.codility.com/">Codility</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a> and my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. Feel free to challenge me on any of these platforms and I may or may not give you a run for your money.

            Besides writing code, I also read often and widely and I'm quite familiar with discussions centering around Christendom history and religiosity, American history, world economics and global finance. I am also quite the linguist and love hunting for grammatical or typographical errors online or in my immediate environment. In case I lost you, I am, in short, a grammar Nazi.
